If red on red, or orange on orange, or black on black works then there is no reason to look at red on orange or red of black or orange on black... it will be easier to just get one and duplicate it. We are already familiar with 0x7c and 0x3c. That orange 0x74 is the path that we took. And that white 0x3c was a nightmare to get... If we could find an easy way to get 0x3c than that would be something... because it was the hardest. Well not even it was the purples that it required that made it tricky...

Alright lets take a quick look at white 3c
white rose 0x3c 60 0b00111100 rrYYwwss is a First generation
The parents are purple rose 0x1c 28 0b00011100 rrYywwss and yellow rose 0x34 52 0b00110100 rrYYWwss This makes two whites. What's the point
The parents are purple rose 0x1c 28 0b00011100 rrYywwss and purple rose 0x1c 28 0b00011100 rrYywwss This is the one that I am all too familiar with
The parents are yellow rose 0x34 52 0b00110100 rrYYWwss and yellow rose 0x34 52 0b00110100 rrYYWwss This could be. two yellows and a white isn't bad

So at this point we can see if there is an easier way to get that puple 1c or if the yellow 34 is easy to get. No the yellow is not great...

Taking a break from Roses lets look at the other flowers
Here is the process that I am developing for finding paths. It's not perfect but its something
I take the all of the flowers that I want to get and I look at all of their possible parents. 
I take all of those parents and pick the ones that are easiest to get.
I repeat the process with those flowers

So for purple hyacinths I put all of the purple hyacs through the process and found all of their parents
Then I ran looked at all of their parents with the possible mates and I picked only the ones that were mating with themselves
Then I put all of those flowers as the flowers I wanted and looked at all of their parents
I found that red and yellow seeds have a 50% change of producing an orange that has a 6% chance of producing a purple... Its not a good chance but it is only two steps...
I may take a closer look at the other parents and see if I can see some better options.
